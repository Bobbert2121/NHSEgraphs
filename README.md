# NHSEgraphs
This is a collection of graphs and analysis made during my placement year at NHS England, mainly using pandas and matplotlib.
Each folder you see above concerns a seperate project/dataset, and to see a graph, just open the appropriate folder and look in the "Graph" folder for the python code. If you run the code on your machine, you should be able to see the graph.
All these graphs are based on publicly available data, so the relevant csv can also be found in the same folder as its ascosciated "Graph" folder.

I have tried to select a good variety of samples to showcase the work done on my placement year, but unfortunately not everything can be shared. If you are interested, please ask and I will be more than happy to talk about the skills involved with the other work in my placement.
