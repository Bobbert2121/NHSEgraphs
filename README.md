# NHSEgraphs
A collection of graphs and analysis made during my placement year at NHS England, mainly using pandas and matplotlib.
Almost all the source data for these graphs was originally downloaded to the local files on my computer.
Although I have done my best to update them, the file path in some of the pd.readcsvs may still refer to my local filepath, and as such will not work if downloaded unedited an run on any other computer.
If this is the case, please download the source data onto your own computer, and update the relevant path.
