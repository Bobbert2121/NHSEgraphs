<b>These figures breakdown the the ethnic make up of the IMD deprivation quintiles in England</b>

The first graph is a stacked bar chart of the ethnic minority population of each IMD Decile in England
The second graph shows the proportion of each decile belonging to each broad ethnic group
The third figure is a series of graphs, with each graph plotting the population of a given broad ethnic group in each IMD decile.
Finally, the fourth bar graph compares the proportion of the population belonging to each broad ethnic group between the CORE20 (most deprived quintile of IMD) and non-CORE20 (all other quintiles) in England

The graphs show that the most deprived areas of England have a higher ethnic minority population, as well as a higher proportion of their population being ethnic minority.
